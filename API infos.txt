	Here is why i can't provide the source code of the API : When you get a private API you can't put the source code everywhere , THATS THE POINT OF A PRIVATE API
	
	
		Know bugs :
		-In wac vehicles, the CalcView hook won't ignore the cursor move.
	
		Changelog :
		(from older to present)
		--v--INTERNAL VERSION--v--
		December 2013 -> February 2014 : Working on it, slow work.
		February 2013 -> All the data on the Build server is lost (Dead HDD)(the server where we work) 
		->  "FUCK OFF"
		February 2014 -> December 2014 : Nothing, i forgot about this project
		December the 26th : Start working on the project on VS2013
		December, the 27th : It's working ! (see bellow) // so yeah, 3 months of work -> nothing ; 1 day of work -> its working
		
		-Its working (Pitch Roll Yaw)
		=Fixing (in lua) non-focus NULL pointer with window handle
		+Adding X Y Z
		+Fixing things in the Lua part
		=Better frame control (timer)
		=Cleaning API (useless functions) /// I BROKE SOMETHING FOK OFF  // ok fixed 
		-> cleaning : 1740kb->41kb->30->27kb->14kb
		+Adding securities (malloc fail, reg read/find key fail)
		+Adding copyright thing // okay, Error() in tier0 is not a error message, it just close gmod with an error message
		--v--PUBLIC VERSION--v--
		+Added leaning system (move your head to the left/right) to lean.
		+Modified some things
		+added NPStatus
		+Fixed things
		
		For peoples acting like : 
		"UHH Y U NO PROVID TEH CODE SOURCE THERE IS MAYBE A VIRUS IN DIS STAHP RITE NOW"
		
		Here are the "maybe dangerous functions used"
		
		-Functions used to read (not write) registry keys : We look here 	"Software\NaturalPoint\NATURALPOINT\NPClient Location" [CENSORED - IM NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO PROVIDE ANY ELEMENT FROM THE ORIGINAL API - CENSORED]
		To check if the NP software is installed and get the NPClient dll location (if a day Gmod move to x64 ( "ahaha don't even think about that" -Garry Newman) the API is ready to move to X64 with the x64 lib and shit)
		NOWHERE ELSE, so yeah it's safe
		
		-LoadLibrary : [CENSORED - IM NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO PROVIDE ANY ELEMENT FROM THE ORIGINAL API - CENSORED]
		We use it to load the NP interface (just what i said before)
		
		There is nothing else really dangerous (nothing dangerous if you don't do shit with the module), there is also segfault protections, some Really important error messages (like if the Registry key is not found) will open a window
		error message with MessageBoxA, because you're not supposed to use the module if you don't have TrackIR (70% of gmod players are retards)
		
		
		
		
		
		
		

		How it works :
		
		The trackir device (usb) track using 4 IR leds and a (2?) camera (so it works in the dark, (don't try the webcam cheap hack, it sucks, for real)), 
		send the raw image (no 255 levels of grey image, only 2 colors on the image) to the TrackIR software, store it and calculate the position
		of the head in a 3d space (we can't do shit here, no api) then, with the api we register the dev ID, load the NaturalPoint interface, send and register Window Handle,
		and all the other shit, send a list of the coordinates
		we want to track, and then we can request an update of the data 120 or 60 times per secs (lua run functions from the module that update the struct (in C) 
		and others lua functions will return the coordinates (see at the bottom)

	// frame rate
		Last TrackIR -> 120 fps
		Oldest ones -> 60 fps
		
	// Lua functions
	
	
	Functions returning coordinates :
	TrackIR_X ; TrackIR_Y ; TrackIR_Z ; TrackIR_Pitch ; TrackIR_Yaw ; TrackIR_Roll
	
	Functions returning debug informations : 
	TrackIR_Debug -> [CENSORED - IM NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO PROVIDE ANY ELEMENT FROM THE ORIGINAL API - CENSORED] (it was the source code, just test it yourself, it return a string with all the data in it)
	
	Functions returning informations : 
	TrackIR_Ver (string) : The version of trackir
	TrackIR_Status : Return the status (0 or 1) , too tired to explain, i'll see later
	
	Functions returning .... nothing : 
	TrackIR_Update  (Request an update for all the coordinates)
